        <bp>Is there equitable access to to sufficient and healthy food across the 
          United States? How does food insecurity compare across the nation?

        <bp><span class="red-color">The goal of our visualization is to highlight 
            the correlations between national food insecurity and various factors, 
            including geography, race and ethnicity, age, and access to a vehicle.</span>
        </bp><br><br>
        <bp>To answer our questions, we used a dataset from the U.S. 
          Department of Agriculture within their Food Access Research Atlas. 
          We used their most recent dataset from 2015, and wrangled and 
          cleaned the data to remove erroneous data and exclusively focus 
          on the columns we wanted to use for data analysis.
        </bp><br><br>
        <bp>Although we designed our visualizations to be accessible and 
          clear for any audience, our specific target audience are 
          people living in the United States. It is our responsibility 
          to ensure that residents are informed of the food insecurity 
          in their local communities and nationwide, how these problems 
          are exacerbated by race and class, and what individuals can do 
          to contribute to the reduction of this problem.

        <bp><i>Food insecurity</i> is when an individual is not sure where their food will come from 
          because they have little or no access to nutritious food. There are many adverse 
          physical and mental effects of food insecurity, including hunger, malnutrition, 
          birth defects, aggression, anxiety, and chronic illness.
        </bp><br><br>
        <bp>For this project, we specifically measured food insecurity as it relates to food 
          deserts. An <i>urban food desert</i> is a county where residents have to drive more than 
          1 mile to the nearest grocery store, while a <i>rural food desert</i> is a county where 
          residents have to drive more than 10 miles to the nearest grocery store. Although 
          both urban and rural communities suffer from scarce access to healthy food, urban 
          areas usually get more assistance. Based on the limitations of our dataset and the 
          fact that there are higher rates of food insecurity in rural food deserts, we decided 
          to exclusively focus on rural food deserts for our analysis.
        </bp><br><br>
        <bp><span class="red-color">Among the 3,141 counties in the United States, 2,074 of them 
          have at least one food desert. This means that more than 65% of the counties in the nation have 
          limited access to affordable and healthy food.</span>

        <p>The heat map shows the states with the largest disparity between racial and ethnic groups 
          living in food deserts. For example, ___ has one of the deepest hues because it has the 
          largest disparity between racial and ethnic groups that live in a rural food desert. 
          In ___, ___% of ___ people are in a rural food desert, whereas a much smaller percentage 
          of ___ people (___%) suffer from food insecurity in a rural food desert. This shows a large 
          disparity between the proportion of any one racial group who are in food deserts.

        <p>“Hunger is not a problem. It is an obscenity. How wonderful it is that nobody 
          need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.” 
          -Anne Frank
        </p>
        <p>All of this data begs the question, what can we do to help? How should areas 
          or populations in the United States be prioritized when it comes to the long 
          and hard fight against food insecurity?
        </p>
        <p>One viable strategy would be to prioritize the counties and areas that are most 
          gravely impacted by food insecurity. We could also further investigate the different 
          demographics who are the most vulnerable to food insecurity, and address their 
          needs first.
        </p>
        <p>This visualization allows us to explore both of these options.

    <h2>Final Project</h2>
    <p>The final project will provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, 
      and deploying interactive visualizations. Your project should address a concrete
      visualization challenge and should propose a novel, creative solution. The final
      deliverable will take the form of a visual analysis tool or an explanatory narrative,
      deployed as an interactive web page. More info on the
      <a href='https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse442/20au/fp.html'>course website</a>.
