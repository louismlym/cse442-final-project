        <bp>We hope to help inform and educate the world about the disparities in food

          for anyone, our specific target audience are people living in the United 
          States. It is our responsibility to ensure that residents are informed of 
          the food insecurity in their local communities and nationwide, how these 
          problems are exacerbated by demographic characteristics, and what 
          individuals can do to contribute to the reduction of this problem.

        <h2>Prevalence of Food Deserts</h2>
        <p><b>Food insecurity</b> is the state of not having access to enough affordable, 
          nutritious food. It can have many adverse physical and mental effects, 
          including malnutrition, birth defects, and chronic illness.
        </p>
        <p>We measured food insecurity in relation to food deserts. An <b>urban 
          food desert</b> is a place where residents have to drive more than 1 mile 
          to the nearest grocery store, while a <b>rural food desert</b> is one where you have 
          to drive more than 10 miles. Since rural food deserts have higher rates of food 
          insecurity and our dataset is limited, we decided to exclusively focus on rural 
          food deserts for our analysis.
        </p>
        <p><!--Drag the slider to see how many counties have at least that many food deserts. <-->
          <span class="red-color">Among the 3,141 counties in the United 
          States, 2,074 of them have at least one food desert. This means that more than 65% of the 
          counties in the nation have limited access to affordable and healthy food.</span>

        <h2>How are different <span class="red-color">racial and ethnic groups</span> relatively impacted by food insecurity?</h2>
        <p>We investigated if there is a correlation between food insecurity and race and 
          ethnicity by calculating the percentage of each demographic group that lives in a 
          food desert in each state and county. Although there is at least a 10% disparity 
          between different racial and ethnic groups that are facing food insecurity in many 
          states, some areas are significantly worse than others. For example, Hughes 
          County, SD has one of the largest disparities with 100% of the Native Hawaiian 
          and other Pacific Islander population in a rural food desert, compared to only 2% 
          of the Asian population.
        </p>
        <!-- <p> We are looking at food deserts where there isn't reliable access to affordable or quality food 
          within 10 miles, so it is worth noting that this could be considered normal in sparsely 
          populated areas, like Yukon-Koyukuk, AK, or pretty impossible in small areas, like Honolulu, HI 
          that is only 68.5 square miles.

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>All of this data begs the question, how can we begin tackling this problem? How 
          should areas or populations in the United States be prioritized in the fight 
          against food insecurity?
        </p>
        <p>We explored two common strategies: prioritizing the areas that are the most gravely 
          impacted by food insecurity, and prioritizing the racial and ethnic demographics 
          who are the most vulnerable to food insecurity.

    <h2>Final Project</h2>
    <p>The final project will provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, 
      and deploying interactive visualizations. Your project should address a concrete
      visualization challenge and should propose a novel, creative solution. The final
      deliverable will take the form of a visual analysis tool or an explanatory narrative,
      deployed as an interactive web page. More info on the
      <a href='https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse442/20au/fp.html'>course website</a>.
