        <p>Is there equitable access to food access across the United States? 
          How does food insecurity compare across the United States? Is there 
          equitable access to food access across the United States? The goal 
          of our visualization is to highlight the correlations between 
          national food insecurity and food deserts and various factors, 
          including race and ethnicity, age, access to a vehicle, and geography.
        </p>
        <p>
          To answer our questions, we used a dataset from the United States 
          Department of Agriculture within their Food Access Research Atlas. 
          We used their <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/">
            most recent dataset from 2015</a>, and wrangled and 
          cleaned the data to remove erroneous data and exclusively focus 
          on the columns we wanted to use for data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we designed our visualizations to be accessible and 
          clear for any audience, our specific target audience are 
          people living in the United States. It is our responsibility 
          to ensure that residents are informed of the food insecurity 
          in their local communities and nationwide, how these problems 
          are exacerbated by race and class, and what individuals can do 
          to contribute to the reduction of this problem.

          The heat map below shows the states with the largest disparity between racial and 
          ethnic groups living in food deserts. The bar graph to its side shows the 
          percentage of each racial and ethnic group for that area is impacted by 
          food insecurity. The heat map is encoded by the maximum disparity between 
          racial and ethnic groups and the amount of food insecurity they experience.

        <h2>How are different  <span class="red-color">states and counties</span> in the United States relatively impacted by food insecurity?</h2>
        <p>All of this data begs the question, how should states be prioritized when it 
          comes to fighting food insecurity? One approach would be to prioritize the areas 
          most gravely impacted by food insecurity. Another approach would be to look more 
          closely at the different demographics who are the most vulnerable. 
          The below graphic lets us examine both.</p>

    <h2>Final Project</h2>
    <p>The final project will provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, 
      and deploying interactive visualizations. Your project should address a concrete
      visualization challenge and should propose a novel, creative solution. The final
      deliverable will take the form of a visual analysis tool or an explanatory narrative,
      deployed as an interactive web page. More info on the
      <a href='https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse442/20au/fp.html'>course website</a>.
